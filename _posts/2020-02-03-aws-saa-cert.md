In September 2020, I decided to learn for and take the AWS SAA-C02 exam.

## My background

To provide some context, I think it's important for me to share my background.

I've been studying Computer Science at one of Hungary's most well-known universities where some of my subjects 
actually touched on AWS. In addition to learning the basic cloud concepts here, I gained some hands-on experience 
with EC2 instance types, spot instances, pricing and running workloads on the VM. I also wrote my thesis about 
developing auto-scaling algorithms in applications built in a microservices architecture. After finishing my studies,
I joined an investment bank where I worked for 3 years. I was in a DevOps-ish role focusing more on the Dev side of 
things. Although I really enjoyed working there, I had no exposure to the public cloud. We instead used an inhouse 
built private cloud solution, where I could deepen my knowledge about cloud native application development. So at the
start of my Solutions Architect learning journey, I would say the basic concepts and theory were in place, but I 
really lacked actual AWS hands-on experience.

## Learning path and resources

I am really thorough when it comes to choosing learning material. After doing my research and finding the [AWS 
Certifications subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/), I opted to use the **video course** from 
[StÃ©phane Maarek's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/). It 
did not disappoint. StÃ©phane's course includes 24 hours of on-demand video - each and every minute full of useful 
information. I actually ended up with 73 pages of notes. I tracked my progress by writing down how much content I 
watched after each learning session. With this approach, I could set deadlines and estimate when I will be ready for 
the practice tests. When I had a full day dedicated just to learning e.g. on the weekends, I could watch about 1.5 
to 2 hrs worth of content while being able to progress about 0.5 to 1 hours on weekdays. Complementary to 
watching the videos, I did hands-on labs as well as digging deeper into topics I was interested in or didn't 
understand for the first time. It turned out, these activities took up about triple as much. Also, on some days 
, I looked at my previous notes to see if I had forgotten any of the concepts I had learned. In other occasions 
I just needed a "day off" from learning.

When I mentioned the **practice tests**, I meant [the ones from Tutorials Dojo's Jon 
Bonso](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-practice-exams/). This 
was just as important to my learning process as the video course. The multiple-choice format is the same as in the 
real exam and the wording is very similar. It not only tested my knowledge, but helped to identify concepts I needed 
to brush up on. Every question includes detailed explanation to why an answer is correct. This was a godsend and 
helped me so much to be successful in the exam. I would advise to achieve 80-85%+ in the practice exams to be 
completely confident in the real exam.

I also participated in a [live exam readiness 
course](https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/exam-workshop-solutions-architect-associate/) provided by
AWS, which was again packed with very useful information, highlighting most important concepts and showing 
differences between services.

## Booking the exam

Before booking the exam, I suggest asking for the extra 30 minutes exam accommodation, if you are a non-native
English speaker. Although I didn't need it, it's still a comforting thought to have some more time. ðŸ™‚

I booked my online exam with Pearson VUE for the 26 October 9:15AM.

## Exam day

Before the exam, I was required to go through a check-in process, where they verified that it's me taking the test 
and I don't have ways to cheat. I was asked to take pictures with my phone of the surroundings and run a program from
Pearson VUE that only allowed me to access their platform. Once they verified these, a proctor joined in and asked me
to identify myself by showing my identification card and face to the camera. For one more time, I had to show my 
surroundings, but in this case, with the camera of my iMac. It felt so weird to lift the whole computer and show the 
desk in front of me! ðŸ™‚

Then, the proctor warned me not to leave the sight of the camera and that my environment needs to be completely 
silent. After that, they released my exam. I had one occasion where the proctor contacted me via voice, because my 
hand was in front of my mouth. I was so surprised they called in for that, because sometimes this just helps me 
think. I had to remind myself to lower my hand several times as I found myself going back to doing it. ðŸ™‚

After I sat through the exam and answered all 65 questions, I got my result: **I PASSED**

I was so happy! Days, weeks and long nights of preparation turn out to be fruitful, such a good feeling!!! ðŸ™‚

## After the exam

I got the official results and my badge after a day.
